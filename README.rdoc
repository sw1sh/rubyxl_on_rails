= RubyXLonRails

Almost identical clone of {SpreadsheetOnRails}[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/10to1/spreadsheet_on_rails] but uses RubyXL and works with *.xlsx files.

Intention was to use this gem also as a modification tool for xlsx files, therefore the default template doesn't contain the creation of a `workbook` variable.

Use something like:
  
  workbook = RubyXL::Parser.parse 'path/to/xlsx/file'

in the beginning of a template.
